California State Fire Dashboard

Overview

The California State Fire Dashboard is an interactive tool designed to analyze and visualize historical wildfire data across California. By leveraging various data visualization techniques, the dashboard provides insights into wildfire trends, high-risk areas, and potential causes, aiding stakeholders in informed decision-making and resource allocation.

Features

Temporal Analysis: Visualizes annual and seasonal wildfire trends to identify high-risk periods.
Geospatial Mapping: Highlights fire-prone regions and assesses fire station coverage.
Categorical Insights: Examines causes of wildfires, distinguishing between natural and human-induced incidents.
Data Sources

Fire Incident Reports: Detailed records of wildfire events, including location, date, and cause.
CAL FIRE Database: Comprehensive data on fire incidents and firefighting resources.
Meteorological Data: Weather information such as temperature, humidity, and wind patterns.
Tools and Technologies

Data Processing: Utilized Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning and transformation.
Geospatial Analysis: Employed GeoPandas and Folium for mapping and spatial analysis.
Visualization: Created interactive charts and maps using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
Text Analysis: Applied NLTK and spaCy for natural language processing of fire reports.
